Commit History:

git revert: Preserves the commit history by adding a new commit.
git reset: Rewrites the commit history by moving the branch pointer.
Safety for Shared Repositories:

git revert: Safe for shared repositories since it doesn't alter existing commits.
git reset: Not safe for shared repositories if commits have already been pushed, as it can cause conflicts for other collaborators.
Scope of Changes:

git revert: Only affects the specified commit.
git reset: Can affect multiple commits depending on how far back the reset goes.
