38. What is Rebasing in GIT?
Rebasing is the process of moving a branch to a new base commit.
It is like rewriting the history of a branch.
In Rebasing, we move a branch from one commit to another. By this we can maintain linear project 
history.
Once the commits are pushed to a public repository, it is not a good practice to use Rebasing.

====================

42. What is the main difference between git clone and git remote?
git clone is used to create a new local repository whereas git remote is used in an existing repository

git remote adds a new reference to existing remote repository for tracking further changes.
git clone creates a new local repository by copying another repository from a URL.

============

. What is git rerere?
In GIT, rerere is a hidden feature. The full form of rerere is “reuse recorded resolution”.

git diff –cached: It displays the differences between the index and the most recent commit.
git diff HEAD: It displays the differences between working directory and the most recent commit


We use git rm –r to recursively remove all files from a leading directory.

51. What is the command to apply a stash?
Sometimes we want to save our unfinished work. For this purpose we use git stash command. Once we 
want to come back and continue working from the last place where we left, we use git stash apply 
command to bring back the unfinished work.

========================

55. What does a commit object contain?

ASH: The SHA1 hash of the Git tree that refers to the state of index at commit time.
Commit Author: The name of person/process doing the commit and date/time.
Comment: Some text messages that contains the reason for the commit .

61. How can we change a commit message in GIT?
 git commit --ammend
 
 When we push the commit, a new message appears on GitHub.

============

2. How can we know if a branch is already merged into master in GIT?
git branch --merged master : This prints the branches merged into master
git branch --merged lists : This prints the branches merged into HEAD (i.e. tip of current branch)
git branch --no-merged : This prints the branches that have not been merged
By default this applies only to local branches.

======================

We can use -a flag to show both local and remote branches.
Or we can use -r flag to show only the remote branches.

4. What is the HEAD in GIT?
A HEAD is a reference to the currently checked out commit.

==================

5. What is the most popular branching strategy in GIT?

There are many ways to do branching in GIT. One of the popular ways is to maintain two branches:
master: This branch is used for production. In this branch HEAD is always in production ready state.
develop: This branch is used for development. In this branch we store the latest code developed in 
project. This is work in progress code.
Once the code is ready for deployment to production, it is merged into master branch from develop 
branch

6. What is SubGit?
SbGit is software tool used for migrating SVN to Git. I

9. What does ‘git pull’ command in GIT do internally?
In GIT, git pull internally does a git fetch first and then does a git merge.
So pull is a combination of two commands: fetch and merge.
We use git pull command to bring our local branch up to date with its remote version.

===========

22. What is the meaning of ‘stage’ in GIT?
In GIT, stage is a step before commit. To stage means that the files are ready for commit.

======================

6. What is stored inside a commit object in GIT?

SHA1 name: A 40 character string to identify a commit
Files: List of files that represent the state of a project at a specific point of time
Reference: Any reference to parent commit objects
==========================

32. What is a pull request in GIT?
A pull request in GIT is the list of changes that have been pushed to GIT repository. Generally these 
changes are pushed in a feature branch or hotfix branch. After pushing these changes we create a pull 
request that contains the changes between master and our feature branch. This pull request is sent to 
reviewers for reviewing the code and then merging it into develop or release branch.


==================

3. What is merge conflict in GIT?
A merge conflict in GIT is the result of merging two commits.
Sometimes the commit to be merged and current commit have changes in same location. In this 
scenario, GIT is not able to decide which change is more important. Due to this GIT reports a merge 
conflict. It means merge is not successful. We may have to manually check and resolve the merge 
conflict

============


Cherry picking in Git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.

78. How can we determine the commit that is the source of a bug in GIT?
In GIT we can use git bisect command to find the commit that has introduced a bug in the system.
We first tell a bad commit that contains the bug and a good commit that was present before the bug 
was introduced.

83. How can we rename a remote repository?
e can use command git remote rename for changing the name of a remote repository

git remote rename repoOldName repoNewName


git config --global alias.co checkout

git branch -v to see the latest commit associated with each branch

git config --global alias.co checkout


88. What are the four major protocols used by GIT for data transfer?
Local
HTTP
Secure Shell (SSH)
Git

92. How can your reorder commits in GIT?
We can use git rebase command to reorder commits in GIT.

=================

94. What is filter-branch in GIT?
In GIT, filter-branch is another option to rewrite history.

95. What are the three main trees maintained by GIT?
HEAD: This is the last commit snapshot.
Index: This is the proposed next commit snapshot.
Working Directory: This is the sandbox for doing changes.


=======================================

8. How can we ignore merge conflicts due to Whitespace
GIT provides an option ignore-space-change in git merge command to ignore the conflicts related to whitespaces

git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace

===========


100. What is a submodule in GIT?
